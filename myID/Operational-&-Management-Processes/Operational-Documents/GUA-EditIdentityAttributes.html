<p>This chapter is defining the scope of the work. Any changes after the formal sign off will need to go through scope change management process: estimation of impact on timelines and effort and formal approval to get it incorporated in the scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; FUNCTIONAL DESIGN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FUNCTIONAL DETAILS (MANDATORY)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.1. Detailed functional Description</p>
<p>This document is to re-define the new process to edit the attributes of an identity cube in the myid system. An identity cube is a collection of identity data that is used to manage access rights and permissions for different applications and systems. The identity attributes are the properties of an identity cube, such as name, email, manager, etc.</p>
<p>In the current process, GUA staffs have access to edit the identity attributes directly from the identity warehouse, which is the central repository of identity data. However, this direct update has created many data quality issues, mainly because the attribute updates in this area are free text fields and no validations are performed. This can lead to inconsistent, inaccurate, or incomplete identity data, which can affect the security and functionality of the myid system and the applications that rely on it.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we propose a new process that follows a proper validation and audit procedure to update the identity attributes. This document will explain the new process and the steps involved in editing the identity attributes.</p>
<p>1.1.1.1. Target Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The targets used in this case is myID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.1.2. Business Functionality</p>
<p>The new process to edit the identity attributes is as follows:</p>
<p>1. We will introduce a new quick link in the myid system that is accessible only to GUA staff.</p>
<p>2. We will disable the capability associated with editing the identity attributes in the identity warehouse.</p>
<p>3. The quick link will launch a workflow to update the identity attributes. The workflow will contain validations and quality checks to handle each of the fields that are updated.</p>
<p>4. Once the field level validations are passed, a confirmation screen will display the changes to be submitted.</p>
<p>5. Custom audit events will capture the changes and the source (requester) in detail.</p>
<p>6. Post audit, a provisioning plan with an access request (auto approved) will be generated to track the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.1.3. In Scope Requirements</p>
<p>The scope of this requirement is to introduce new quicklink form for GUA team to perform update identity attributes like as-is in the same way that they are doing through OOTB edit attributes screen.</p>
<p>As phase1 we will introduce validations only for the following fields :</p>
<p>Identity Attribute Validations to be introduced Use Case binding</p>
<p>Identity Type &nbsp; Value to selected from dropdown Identity type changes – for example shared ID to Shared Mailbox,</p>
<p>Last Name / First Name &nbsp; Special characters check only for secondary identities</p>
<p>Windows Login ID &nbsp; check for existence in the System as name of secondary identity / main user id of existing or users who left henkel Valid - Incase of garden leaver</p>
<p>Mobile Number &nbsp; Valid mobile number format Update of mobile number - based on request ticket received</p>
<p>Manager &nbsp; Only active personal primary users Valid - for the garden leaver</p>
<p>Owner &nbsp; only active personal primary users Changing owner of secondary identities – based on request</p>
<p>No Usage Check / Power BI Check / Leaver Exception / Locked By SOC &nbsp; True / False Valid</p>
<p>Inactive &nbsp; True/False. Also should trigger a special process to disable / enable all associated accounts in plan Valid</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; High Level Technical Information</p>
<p>The steps to update the identity attributes using the new process are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Log in to the myid system and click on the quick link that says "Edit Identity Attributes". This will launch the workflow to update the identity attributes.</p>
<p>2. Select the identity cube that needs to be updated.</p>
<p>3. Fill in the fields that need to be updated. The workflow will perform validations and quality checks on each field. For example, it will check if the email format is valid, if the manager exists in the system, if the identity type is consistent with the identity sub type, etc. If there are any errors or warnings, the workflow will display them and ask you to correct them or confirm them.</p>
<p>4. Once all the fields are filled in and validated, click on the "Submit" button. A confirmation screen will show the changes that will be made to the identity cube. Review the changes and click on the "Confirm" button.</p>
<p>5. The workflow will generate custom audit events that will capture the changes and the source (requester) in detail. These audit events will be stored in the myID system and can be viewed by authorized users.</p>
<p>6. The workflow will also generate a provisioning plan with an access request that will track the changes. The access request will be auto approved, and the changes will be applied to the identity cube.</p>
<p>7. The identity which is updated (owner in case it is secondary) , GUA team member will send notification that the identity attributes have been updated successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1 Objective</p>
<p>This document is to re-define the new process to edit the attributes of an identity cube in the myid system. An identity cube is a collection of identity data that is used to manage access rights and permissions for different applications and systems. The identity attributes are the properties of an identity cube, such as name, email, manager, etc.</p>
<p>In the current process, GUA staffs have access to edit the identity attributes directly from the identity warehouse, which is the central repository of identity data. However, this direct update has created many data quality issues, mainly because the attribute updates in this area are free text fields and no validations are performed. This can lead to inconsistent, inaccurate, or incomplete identity data, which can affect the security and functionality of the myid system and the applications that rely on it.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we propose a new process that follows a proper validation and audit procedure to update the identity attributes. This document will explain the new process and the steps involved in editing the identity attributes.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assumption</p>
<p>• GUA must have knowledge on myID functionality</p>
<p>• GUA team members must be member of their existing workgroup</p>
<p>• GUA team should aware the edit identity attribute functionality which they are performing already using OOTB screen.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dependencies / Constraints</p>
<p>• myID Servers are up and running.</p>
<p>• AD and other target applications should be up and running</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technical Flow Diagram</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Logic of the development</p>
<p>The steps to update the identity attributes using the new process are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Log in to the myid system and click on the quick link that says "Edit Identity Attributes". This will launch the workflow to update the identity attributes.</p>
<p>2. Select the identity cube that needs to be updated.</p>
<p>3. Fill in the fields that need to be updated. The workflow will perform validations and quality checks on each field. For example, it will check if the email format is valid, if the manager exists in the system, if the identity type is consistent with the identity sub type, etc. If there are any errors or warnings, the workflow will display them and ask you to correct them or confirm them.</p>
<p>4. Once all the fields are filled in and validated, click on the "Submit" button. A confirmation screen will show the changes that will be made to the identity cube. Review the changes and click on the "Confirm" button.</p>
<p>5. The workflow will generate custom audit events that will capture the changes and the source (requester) in detail. These audit events will be stored in the myID system and can be viewed by authorized users.</p>
<p>6. The workflow will also generate a provisioning plan with an access request that will track the changes. The access request will be auto approved, and the changes will be applied to the identity cube.</p>
<p>7. The identity which is updated (owner in case it is secondary) , GUA team member will send notification that the identity attributes have been updated successfully.</p>
<p>7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output</p>
<p>This document has explained the new process to edit the identity attributes in the myid system. The new process will ensure that the identity data is consistent, accurate, and complete, and that the changes are validated and audited. The new process will also improve the security and functionality of the myid system and the applications that rely on it.</p>
